# City Mobility Amsterdam
The project investigates sustainable approaches to improve mobility in the city of Amsterdam by exploring the relationship between the average car speed and number of cyclists on a specific street. 

The project contributes to the challenges the municipality of Amsterdam is facing with respect to mobility in two ways. First, a data-driven investigation is done into the relation between the average car speed and the number of cyclists on a street. The findings can in turn be used to give advice on policy implementation and development. Second, a predictive model is generated that is integrated within an interactive data visualization tool, whereby on a street-by-street bases employees from the municipality are able to see what the possible implications are, per street, of changing the car speed.
